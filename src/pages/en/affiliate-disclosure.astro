          Some links on this site are affiliate links. If you click them and make a purchase, we earn a small commission — at no extra cost to you. This helps fund our work. Our recommendations are always independent.

        <h2 class="font-display text-xl font-bold text-ink mb-3">Amazon Associates Program</h2>
        <p>
          HomeOfficeSetup.net is a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for sites to earn advertising fees by advertising and linking to Amazon.com.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-3">
          As an Amazon Associate, we earn from qualifying purchases. This means that when you click on certain links on our site and make a purchase on Amazon, we receive a small commission.
        </p>

        <h2 class="font-display text-xl font-bold text-ink mb-3">How This Affects Our Recommendations</h2>
        <p>
          Our editorial process is entirely independent of our affiliate relationships. We do not:
        </p>
        <ul class="mt-3 space-y-1 list-none">
          {[
            'Rank products based on commission rates',
            'Accept payment for product placement',
            'Receive free products in exchange for positive reviews',
            'Modify our recommendations based on affiliate partner requests',
          ].map(item => (
            <li class="flex items-start gap-2">
              <span class="text-red-500 shrink-0 mt-0.5">✗</span>
              {item}
            </li>
          ))}
        </ul>
        <p class="mt-4">
          We may earn identical commissions on all Amazon products (the rate is category-based, not product-specific), which means recommending a cheaper product earns us less — yet we consistently do so when it's the better value for you.
